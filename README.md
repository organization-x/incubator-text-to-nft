<h3>Introduction:</h3> 

Our Text to NFT product is one that allows users create a collection of NFTs using a text prompt given by the user. These NFTs can then be found on various collection sites such as Thirdweb and OpenSea. This product was created by the Text-to-NFT group during AI Camp's Team-Tomorrow Incubator program.
