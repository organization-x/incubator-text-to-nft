<h3>Introduction:</h3> 

Text to NFT is a website which allows users to enter any text prompt. This text prompt then will be used to generate an image and will be minted into an NFT. The minted NFT is then on the blockchain and can be found on Opensea and Web3. This product was created by the Text-to-NFT team during the AI Camp Team Tomorrow Incubator program.
